# Image classification project

This project was requested to assist a photographer. This photographer (client) is passionate about motocross, and after each competition, he needs to sort all his photos based on the rider present in the image. This task is quite tedious, and he wishes to automate it using image classification. He does not require all his photos to be perfectly classified but wants the highest-quality (and therefore the most visually appealing) images to be correctly identified. I have set a baseline of 50% accurate classification for my algorithm.
